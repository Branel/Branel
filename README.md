Started learning programming in a more serious way in 2021.<br /><br />
 Feedback wherever possible is always appreciated.<br /><br />
 Currently reading: Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++ by Bjarne Stroustrup<br />
 Have any good book suggestions? Shoot me a email or find me on discord. I'd prefeer for them to be relevant for Computer Science as I intend to study for it.
