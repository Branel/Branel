I develop as a hobby in C++ and Python, I have plans to pursue a career in Computer Science.
I'm always on the lookout for open source projects to help myself improve by looking at other great programmers source code.
A lot of my projects will go from open to private constantly depending on what I am doing and how confident I am about it.
