Started learning programming in a more serious way in 2021.<br /><br />
 Feedback wherever possible is always appreciated, currently I am invested in open source World of Warcraft projects because I have deep knowledge of the game and hope to use it as a means to learn C++ & SQL. Also to learn to use GitHub properly and learn how to read other peoples code and improve upon it!<br /><br />
 Currently reading: Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++ by Bjarne Stroustrup<br />
 Have any good book suggestions? Shoot me a email or find me on discord. I'd prefeer for them to be relevant for Computer Science as I intend to study for it.
