I develop as a hobby in C++ and Python, I have plans to pursue a career in Computer Science.
I'm always on the lookout for open source projects to help myself improve by looking at other great programmers source code.

A lot of my projects will go from open to private constantly depending on what I am doing and how confident I am about it. I'm always happy to get feedback on my projects but beware of inactivity on older projects where my code might have improved by then, I will only consider the most relevant criticism but if I get feedback on a older project it will 
most likely get dismissed.
Thanks for reading.
